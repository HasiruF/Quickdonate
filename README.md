# QuickDonate 

QuickDonate is a Flutter-based donation and fundraising mobile application that allows users to **browse campaigns**, **donate securely(sandbox only)**, and **manage their own fundraising campaigns**. The app leverages **Firebase** for authentication and real-time data management, with payment integration handled securely via a payment gateway.

This project was developed as part of an academic group project to demonstrate mobile app development, cloud-based data management, and secure payment workflows.
